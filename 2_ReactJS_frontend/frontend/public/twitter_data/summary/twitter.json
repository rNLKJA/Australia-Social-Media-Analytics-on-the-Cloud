      "Twitter data is in JSON format, a lightweight and widely used data interchange format. Within this format, each individual tweet is encapsulated as a JSON item, encompassing various key attributes. These attributes include the unique identifier of the tweet on Twitter (tid), the username of the author who posted the tweet (author), the precise timestamp indicating the date and time of its creation (date), the language in which the tweet is composed (lang), the actual textual content of the tweet itself, location of where this tweet is made (location), the corresponding SAL code denoting the specific region (sal), and finally, a sentiment score ranging from 1 to 9. This sentiment score serves as an evaluative measure, providing insights into the sentiment conveyed by the tweet, with lower scores reflecting more negative sentiment and higher scores indicating a more positive sentiment.",
      "Based on the analysis of Twitter data in Victoria, it was found that the distribution of tweets mentioning income-related terms is highly uneven across SA2 regions. Approximately 73% of the regions have only 1-10 tweets related to income, while 22% have 10-100 tweets, and only 4.7% have more than 100 tweets. Notably, Melbourne stands out with a significant concentration of income-related tweets, totaling 23.281k tweets, surpassing other regions by a large margin. However, the SUDO data, which indicates median income, does not show a similar concentration in high-income regions around Melbourne.",
      "The average sentiment scores of tweets discussing income-related topics exhibit an even distribution, ranging from 1 to 9, without any clear clusters or patterns. Therefore, there is no clear indication that people in higher or lower median income areas tweet more frequently about income-related topics, and no significant correlation between sentiment and income-related tweets was found.",
      "Regarding crime-related topics, no significant clusters or patterns were identified in the average sentiment scores of tweets discussing crime. However, in the second scenario, it was observed that Ballarat, with a relatively high occurrence of offenses and a significant number of tweets mentioning crime-related terms, has a higher probability of being a dangerous region. Nonetheless, there is no significant correlation between the sentiment of tweets and crime-related topics.",
      "In summary, the analysis of Twitter data does not provide strong evidence to suggest that people in higher or lower median income areas tweet more about income-related topics or that sentiment of tweets is correlated with income. Similarly, no significant correlation between sentiment and crime-related tweets was found, although Ballarat stands out as a region with a higher probability of being dangerous based on crime occurrence and tweets mentioning crime-related terms."
