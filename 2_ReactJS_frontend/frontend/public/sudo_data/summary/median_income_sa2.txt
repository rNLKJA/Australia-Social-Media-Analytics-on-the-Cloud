The income dataset from sudo presents information about income distribution in financial year of 2015-2016 across Australia, and is based on Statistical Area Level 2 according to the 2016 edition of the Australian Statistical Geography Standard. Among all attributes in this dataset, analysis is chosen to be focus on the columns mean, median, sum and median age of earners where the column of the SA2 code 2016 will be used to join with the shapefile to plot the heat map. 

The original size of this dataset covers 2288 sa2 regions, after removing the ones containing null value in any of the columns there are 2234 regions left. Since the twitter data is at granularity of GCC, so this income dataset is further grouped by GCC codes. Then a summary of the dataset is performed, statistics is shown in the table. 

As shown in the box plot and the summary table, there are no outliers in the income mean, median and sum columns, so no outlier removal for this dataset.

Moreover, a heat map is plot for each column. From the map we can see that 5RWAU (Rest of West Austrlia) has the highest income mean of 71.5k aud, 2RVIC (Rest of Victoria) had the lowest income mean of 49.6k aud. Overall the average income in the Northwest is higher than in the Southeast. 8ACTE (Australian Capital Territory) has the highest median income of 60.2 aud, this makes sense because the capital, Canberra, is here. 2RVIC (Rest of Victoria) had the lowest median income of 41.4k aud. In general, the Greater capital cities have similar median income around 50k aud. For the sum of the income tends to have the opposite trend to average 
income, eastern regions are higher than western regions. This implies that the population in the easter regions is more than the western regions. For the median age of earners, all regions look very close except 8ACTE, this region is indicated to have much younger earners.
